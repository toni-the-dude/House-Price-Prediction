# House Price Prediction

## Overview

[Youtube-guided](https://youtu.be/Wqmtf9SA_kk?si=J0DOtNAgGoupDGH2) Machine Learning tutorial in Python. The dataset that is being worked on is the [California housing prices dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices?resource=download). The aim was to predict the values from the column "median_house_value" using the values of the other columns with the dataset.


## Usage

Simply access the [jupiter notebook file](https://github.com/toni-the-dude/House-Price-Prediction/blob/main/main.ipynb) attached to this repository to be able to see the code in action.

## Walkthrough

The jupyter notebook is sectioned according to the steps I have taken. My various comments also help explain the code.

The main sections to look for within the code are:
<ol>
  <li>Loading the dataset</li>
  <li>Exploring the data</li>
  <li>Preprocessing the data</li>
  <li>Feature engineering</li>
  <li>Applying the linear regression model</li>
  <li>Applying the random forest model</li>
</ol>

## Conclusion

This is my first time seeing Random Tree Forest in action. This, alongside the rehearsal of common Data Science steps and methodologies helped me further memorize and understand the process of building such applications.
